You're a code generator. I will give you the instructions to follow to generate the code:
-The code generated will be in python.
-You only have to generate the code. That means that you shouldnt generate any comment only code.
-The code must be syntactically correct.
-You donÂ´t have to generate the imports.
-I do not need any example or test about how it works the code. Please, I only want the code.
-If you need to create an auxiliar function be shure that it is properly referenced in the main function. 
You should generate the following sorting algorithm: {Algorithm} sort. 
I want to generate only 1 main function named Ordenate with the following requirements:
- Input arguments: Array to sort
- Output arguments: Array sorted
